# Data Vizualization using D3 
UC Berkeley - MIDS - w209 Spring 2022 term

## As part of our final project, we hope to visualize characters (and their interactions) from the Star Wars franchise.

- EDA folder contains Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis ([Link to Jupyer Notebook with EDA](./EDA/src/star_wars_dataset_eda.ipynb))
- Our sample Observable notebook here https://observablehq.com/d/13e08c636f495f05 shows how we plan on visualizing our dataset
- We also have our Flask based site running on Berkeley's servers! This link here https://apps-spring21.ischool.berkeley.edu/~vbeohar/w209/ is where we will host our final project (already updated with the sample viz)

## Usability study 
- We conducted a mid-term usability study to assess feedback. ([Here is our study](./files/Usability_Study.pdf))

## Credits 
- We adapted our study from the Star Wars analysis conducted by Evalina Gabasova. Link here https://github.com/evelinag/StarWars-social-network.
